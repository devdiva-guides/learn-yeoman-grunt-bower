# Workflow Automation: Yeoman, Grunt and Bower

Sometimes refered to as the "modern front-end workflow" these three tools are used for front-end app development.



## Using Grunt

In this week's dev munch we will get hand's on popular CLI tools used for automating parts of the front-end development workflow.  Bring your laptops for some real-time learning!

### Overview

Front-end build tools [Value proposition].  Today, we'll look at some of the ways you can use these tools to enhance  your workflow.

* Live reload to get immediate feedback and accelerate your workflow
* Task runners 

* Live reload your browser, see the results of your code changes real-time, in-browsers.  This is especially useful when working with pre-processors or server-side scripting (php, less, sass, erb, jsp, etc...)

## Install Tools


Agenda:

    Installfest – Already setp? Help your colleagues or just munch on your lunch.

            yo
            bower
            Grunt
    Activities – Depending on the time, we will go through the following activities:
        Exploring the task runner / live reload workflow
        Use CLI tools to separate and manage source and distribution version(s) of your code
        Using CLI tools alongside Edge Animate
        Using CLI tools to automate visual validation
